# TrustMarket

Today, with the help of Filecoin Virtual Machine, it paved a way to build Data markteplces to sell and but data in a secured and safe manner. But what if the data that we are buying is not the data that we wanted.   
Trustmarket solves this. 

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
