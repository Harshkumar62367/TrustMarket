# TrustMarket

Today, with the help of Filecoin Virtual Machine, it paved a way to build Data markteplces to sell and but data in a secured and safe manner. But what if the data that we are buying is not the data that we wanted.   
And, Since datamarketplace are permissionsless, there are bound to be a ton of fake dataset listed on any datamarketplace. Unlike NFT where projects are validated and unique artists are validated, dataset on the datamarket can come from any source anonymous or popular and this makes it really important to combat fraudulent intent to keep marketplace free from fraudulent dataset.   

Which is where <b>Trustmarket<b> fits in, it provides a standard for resolving any fraudulent dataset with a DAO that governs the validity of a dataset.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
